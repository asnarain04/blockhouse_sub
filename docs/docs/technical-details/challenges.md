# Challenges & Solutions

During the development of the Crypto Price Tracker, we encountered several challenges and implemented solutions to address them. This section outlines these challenges and how we overcame them.

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge

The CoinGecko API has rate limits for free tier usage (around 10-50 calls per minute). Exceeding these limits results in API errors.

### Solution

1. Implemented caching with React Query to reduce the number of API calls
2. Set a reasonable stale time (60 seconds) to prevent excessive refetching
3. Added a manual refresh button to give users control over when to fetch fresh data
4. Implemented error handling to gracefully handle rate limit errors

## Responsive Design

### Challenge

Creating a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices while displaying complex financial data.

### Solution

1. Used Tailwind CSS for responsive design
2. Implemented a grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
3. Designed cryptocurrency cards that display essential information clearly on all devices
4. Used responsive typography and spacing

## Search Performance

### Challenge

Implementing a search feature that filters cryptocurrencies efficiently without causing performance issues.

### Solution

1. Implemented client-side filtering for immediate feedback
2. Optimized the search algorithm to filter by both name and symbol
3. Used debouncing to prevent excessive re-renders during typing
4. Ensured the search is case-insensitive for better user experience

## Data Formatting

### Challenge

Displaying financial data in a user-friendly format, especially for large numbers and currency values.

### Solution

1. Created utility functions for formatting currency values with appropriate decimal places
2. Implemented formatting for large numbers (billions, millions) to improve readability
3. Used color coding for price changes (green for positive, red for negative)
4. Added visual indicators (arrows) to make price trends immediately apparent

## Error Handling

### Challenge

Providing meaningful error feedback to users when API calls fail.

### Solution

1. Implemented comprehensive error handling in the API client
2. Created user-friendly error messages that explain what went wrong
3. Designed an error UI component that displays errors without disrupting the user experience
4. Added retry functionality to recover from temporary errors

## Future Challenges

As we continue to develop the Crypto Price Tracker, we anticipate the following challenges:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Implementing WebSocket connections for live price updates
2. **Historical Data**: Adding charts and historical data visualization
3. **User Preferences**: Storing and managing user preferences (favorite cryptocurrencies, preferred currency)
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the application remains performant as we add more features

We plan to address these challenges in future updates to the application.
